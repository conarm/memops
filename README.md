# Custom `malloc` and `free` Implementation for MIT's xv6 OS

## Summary

This project involves the implementation of custom versions of the malloc and free memory management functions for MIT's xv6 operating system. The key features of this implementation include:

 - Free List Management: A linked list data structure is used to manage free memory spaces. Each node in this list represents a block of free memory and is stored within the free space itself, optimizing memory usage.

 - Best-Fit Allocation Strategy: The implementation uses a best-fit strategy for memory allocation, minimizing wasted space by selecting the smallest suitable free block for allocation.

 - Efficient Memory Handling: Allocated memory is tracked using a header structure placed before the allocated region, which stores metadata such as the size of the block and a magic number for integrity checks.

 - Memory Coalescence: Adjacent free memory blocks are automatically merged (coalesced) to reduce fragmentation and optimize the use of available memory.

 - Comprehensive Error Handling: The functions include safeguards against invalid memory requests, such as disallowing allocations smaller than 1 byte and imposing an upper limit on allocation size.

This implementation emphasizes efficiency and robustness, making it a valuable learning experience in understanding low-level memory management, pointer arithmetic, and system calls within the xv6 operating system.
